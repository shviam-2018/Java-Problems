<h2>Printing data</h2>

<p>When you write programs, you often need to <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/13775" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, 'print' is a statement used to display output to the console. | It writes the specified text or variable value to the standard output stream, which is typically the console. Unlike 'println', 'print' does not add a newline character after the output, meaning that subsequent print statements will continue writing on the same line. It's a fundamental tool for providing feedback and displaying results in a Java program.">print</a> calculation <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/9955" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, the term result typically refers to the output or value produced by a method or function after it has completed its execution. | This result can be of any data type, including primitive types like int, float, or boolean, or reference types like arrays or objects. The result is usually returned to the caller of the method or function using the return statement. It's important to note that not all methods or functions in Java have a result, as some are designed to perform a specific action or modify an object's state without producing a value.">results</a>, text, or any other type of <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/9723" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, data is separated into two main categories: primitive types and reference types. | Primitive types are built-in data types provided by the language, such as int for integers, and they are represented as lowercase keywords. Reference types, on the other hand, represent objects and are typically created using the new keyword, which allocates memory for the object and initializes the variable. String is a commonly used reference type, and it can be instantiated using either a constructor or a literal, like Hello, World! .">data</a>. Also, throughout this educational platform, you will write a lot of programs that print data on the screen. Let's learn how to do that using a standard approach in Java.</p>

<p><strong>Standard output</strong> is a receiver to which a program can send information as text. It is supported by all common <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3521" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, operating system is the underlying software that manages computer hardware and provides various services for computer programs. | Java is designed to be platform-independent, meaning it can run on any operating system without modification. The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is responsible for interacting with the operating system and managing memory, file I/O, and other system resources. Java applications are written in Java language and are compiled into bytecode, which is then executed by the JVM on the target operating system.">operating systems</a>. Java provides a special <code class="language-java">System.out</code> object to work with the <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/9055" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="The standard output in Java refers to the default location where a Java program prints its output. | This is usually the console or terminal window where the program is run. It is often used to display messages, results, or any other information that the program needs to communicate to the user. The standard output is typically accessed through the System.out object, which represents the standard output stream in Java.">standard output</a>. We will often use it to print data.</p>
<p>The <code class="language-java">println</code> method displays the passed <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3522" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="A string in Java is a reference type consisting of characters, and it is one of the most widely used types in Java. | Strings are immutable, meaning their characters cannot be changed once created. They have methods for getting individual characters and extracting substrings, and they work with text, whether it's a simple hello, world! or a complex document. Strings are everywhere in Java code, and understanding how to use them effectively is fundamental for any Java developer.">string</a> followed by a new line on the screen (<strong>print-line</strong>). For example, the following code snippet prints four lines.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">System.out.println("I ");
System.out.println("know ");
System.out.println("Java ");
System.out.println("well.");
</code></pre>
<p>Here is the output we get:</p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">I
know
Java
well.</code></pre>
<p>All the strings were printed as they are, without double quotes.</p>
<p>This method allows you to print an empty line when no string is given:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">System.out.println("Java is a popular programming language.");
System.out.println(); // prints empty line
System.out.println("It is used all over the world!");</code></pre>
<p>And here is the output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Java is a popular programming language.

It is used all over the world!</code></pre>
<p>The <code class="language-java">print</code> method displays the value that was passed in and places the cursor (the position where we display a value) after it. For example, the code below outputs all strings in a single line.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">System.out.print("I ");
System.out.print("know ");
System.out.print("Java ");
System.out.print("well.");
</code></pre>
<p>We receive the following output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">I know Java well.</code></pre>
<p>Pay attention to the spaces between words. We pass them to the method for printing.</p>
<p></p><div class="alert alert-primary">
<p>4 letters<strong> sout</strong> and pressing the <strong>Tab</strong> key in the IntelliJ IDEA development environment will automatically write <code class="language-java">System.out.println()</code> for you</p>

<h5 id="printing-numbers-and-characters" style="text-align: center;">Printing numbers and characters</h5>
<p>Both <code class="language-java">println</code> and <code class="language-java">print</code> methods allow a program to print not only strings and <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3522" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a character is a single symbol, denoted with a single quote, that can represent a letter, digit, whitespace, or other symbols. | It is actually an integer type that stores the Unicode integer value of each character, which is why character literals can be used as integers if needed. The numeric value of a character can be found in a special table online, and since Java 7, underscores can be used between digits to increase the readability of numeric literals.">characters</a>, but also numbers.</p>
<p>Let's print two secret codes.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">System.out.print(108);   // printing a number
System.out.print('c');   // printing a character that represents a letter
System.out.print("Q");   // printing a string
System.out.println('3'); // printing a character that represents a digit

System.out.print(22);
System.out.print('E');
System.out.print(8);
System.out.println('1');
</code></pre>
<p>Here is our output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">108cQ3
22E81</code></pre>
<p>As is the case with strings, none of the printed characters contain quotes.</p>
<h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5>
<p>In Java, you can print data via the standard output using the <code class="language-java">System.out</code> object. You can use the <code class="language-java">println</code> method to display the passed string in a print-line and the <code class="language-java">print</code> method to output all passed strings in a single line. Both of these methods also allow for printing numbers as well as characters. </p>
