<h2>Basic literals: numbers, strings and characters</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p>Regardless of its complexity, a program always performs <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3582" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="An operation in Java refers to a specific action performed on data, such as arithmetic, logical, or relational operations. | Arithmetic operations include addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus, while logical operations involve Boolean values using AND, OR, and NOT. Relational operations compare values and return a Boolean result, such as equal to, not equal to, less than, greater than, less than or equal to, and greater than or equal to. These operations are fundamental to programming and are used to manipulate and evaluate data within a Java program.">operations</a> on numbers, <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3551" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="A string in Java is a reference type consisting of characters, and it is one of the most widely used types in Java. | Strings are immutable, meaning their characters cannot be changed once created. They have methods for getting individual characters and extracting substrings, and they work with text, whether it's a simple hello, world! or a complex document. Strings are everywhere in Java code, and understanding how to use them effectively is fundamental for any Java developer.">strings</a>, and other values. These values are called <strong>literals</strong>. There are many different sorts of literals in Java, but in this topic we will focus only on a few of them: the ones that surround us all the time in everyday life.</p>

<p>Consider literals as groceries. To use them, usually you need to store them somewhere. Typically, they are stored in variables, which you can think of as containers designed to hold a specific type of <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/9723" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, data is separated into two main categories: primitive types and reference types. | Primitive types are built-in data types provided by the language, such as int for integers, and they are represented as lowercase keywords. Reference types, on the other hand, represent objects and are typically created using the new keyword, which allocates memory for the object and initializes the variable. String is a commonly used reference type, and it can be instantiated using either a constructor or a literal, like Hello, World! .">data</a>. </p>
<p><a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3518" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a variable is a named storage location that is used to store a value of a specific type. | It is declared with a specific data type, which determines the kind of value that can be stored in it. Every variable has a unique name, also known as an identifier, which is used to access its value. Variables can be declared and initialized in a single statement, and their values can be accessed and modified throughout the program.">Variables</a> can only store matching data. You wouldn't want to accidentally put honey in a cardboard cereal box or pour cereal into a salt shaker. To prevent such mistakes, learn to distinguish between the basic literals: <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3565" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, an integer number is a type of primitive data type that represents whole numbers, both positive and negative, as well as zero. | The most commonly used integer types are byte, short, int, and long, with int being the default type. These types can store numbers within specific ranges, with int being able to store numbers between -2,147,483,648 and 2,147,483,647.">integer numbers</a>, strings, and characters.</p>
<h5 id="integer-numbers">Integer numbers</h5>
<p>You use these numbers to count things in the real world as natural numbers. Integer numbers also include zero and negative ones. Here are several examples of valid integer number literals separated by commas: <code class="language-java">0, 1, 2, 10, 11, -100</code>.</p>
<p>Here is how integers can be used in code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">int numApples = 1000;</code></pre>
<p>Reading code is crucial for anyone in IT, so let's parse it together. Here you put the integer 1000 into a variable of an <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3565" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, the integer type is a primitive data type that represents whole numbers, including positive, negative, and zero. | The most commonly used integer types are `int` and `long`. The `int` type can store numbers within a smaller range, which is often enough for many purposes. The `long` type can store larger numbers. Integer types can be used to perform all arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus.">integer type</a>, called numApples. This is similar to filling a container with its designated contents!</p>
<p>You can increase code readability by dividing the digit into blocks with <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/10545" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="The underscore in Java is a special character that can be used to separate groups of digits within a number to improve code readability. | It is allowed to use an underscore between digits since Java 7, but there are certain limitations, such as not being able to use it at the beginning or end of the literal, adjacent to the decimal point, or before the 'f' or 'd' suffix. The underscore is ignored during calculations or when printing the output.">underscores</a>: <code class="language-java">1_000_000</code> is more readable than <code class="language-java">1000000</code>. So let's pack our apples to make selling them easier:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">int numPackedApples = 1_000_000;</code></pre>
<p>Fear not if these code snippets aren't 100% clear to you yet! They aim to help you develop the skill of code reading. Just grasp the overall meaning and follow your study plan, and you'll be writing your own code in no time!</p>
<h5 id="characters">Characters</h5>
<p>A character is a single symbol, denoted with single quotes. You can use <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/10545" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, character literal is a way to represent a single symbol or character, denoted by single quotes. | It is actually an integer type that stores the Unicode integer value of each character. This means that character literals can be used as integers if needed. A character is a single symbol, such as a letter, digit, whitespace, or other character or symbol. It is important to note that character literals should not be confused with the digits they represent. Characters sit between integers and strings in Java, sharing some similarities with both.">character literals</a> to represent single letters like <code class="language-java">'A', 'x'</code>, digits from <code class="language-java">'0'</code> to <code class="language-java">'9'</code>, whitespaces <code class="language-java">(' ')</code>, and other characters or symbols like <code class="language-java">'$'</code>.</p>
<p>Be mindful of quotes and avoid confusing characters representing digits with the digits themselves:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">char charOne = '1'
int numOne = 1</code></pre>
<p>Fun fact: characters sit between integers and strings: they resemble strings, yet you can do math with them. </p>
<h5 id="strings">Strings</h5>
<p>A string is a sequence of characters, encapsulated by double quotes. It represents text-based information, such as an advertising line, a webpage address, or a website login name. Here are some valid examples: <code class="language-java">"text", "I want to know Java", "123456", "e-mail@gmail.com"</code>. As you can see, a string can include letters, digits, whitespaces, and other charactes altogether.</p>
<p>A string consisting of a single character like <code class="language-java">"A"</code> is also a valid string, but do not confuse it with the <code class="language-java">'A'</code> character. Note the difference in quotes!</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">char singleQuoted = 'A'
String doubleQuoted = "A"</code></pre>
<h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5>
<p>You have learned to distinguish between the following literals:</p>
<ul>
<li>123 is an integer number, "123" is a string;</li>
<li>'A' is a character, "A" is a string;</li>
<li>'1' is a character, 1 is an integer number.</li>
</ul>
