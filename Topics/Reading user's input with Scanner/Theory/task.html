For example, the following code snippet reads the user's name and prints a <em>hello</em> message:</p><pre><code class="language-java">public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

The Java compiler removes incidental whitespace and leaves essential whitespace in the string.">whitespace</a>. On the other hand, the <code class="language-java">nextLine()</code> method includes all space <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3522" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a character is a single symbol, denoted with a single quote, that can represent a letter, digit, whitespace, or other symbols. | It is actually an integer type that stores the Unicode integer value of each character, which is why character literals can be used as integers if needed.

As you know already, the program will read input from the cursor's position to the new line (again, if such a line exists in your input). In this example, the cursor is placed before the new line.
