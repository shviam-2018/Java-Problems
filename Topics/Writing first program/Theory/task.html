Keywords cannot be used as variable names in your own program.">keyword</a> followed by the class name. A class can have any name, such as <code class="language-java">App</code>, <code class="language-java">Main</code>, or <code class="language-java">Program</code>, but it must not start with a digit. A set of braces <code class="language-java">{...}</code> encloses the body of a class.</p><pre><code class="language-java">public class Main {
    // ...
}</code></pre><p>The text after <code class="language-java">//</code> is just a comment, not a part of the program. We will learn about comments in detail in later topics.</p><p><strong>2. The <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3489" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="The main method in Java is the entry point for any application and the starting point for program execution. | It is a special method that is declared with the keyword public static void main(String[] args).

The name of this method (<code class="language-java">main</code>) is predefined and should always be the same. Capitalization matters: if you name your first method <strong>Main</strong>, <strong>MAIN</strong> or something else, the program cannot start.</p><p>The element <code class="language-java">String[] args</code> represents a sequence of arguments passed to the program from the outside world. Don't worry about them right now.</p><p><strong>3. Printing "Hello, World!"</strong>. The body of the method consists of programming statements that determine what the program should do after starting. Our program prints the string <strong>"Hello, World!"</strong> using the following statement:</p><pre><code class="language-java">System.out.println("Hello, World!"); //  each statement has to end with ;</code></pre><p>This is one of the most important things to understand from the <strong>Hello World</strong> program. We invoke a special method <code class="language-java">println</code> to display a string followed by a new line on the screen.

The text is printed without double quotes.</p><p> </p><p></p><div class="alert alert-warning"><p>It is important that <strong>"Hello, World!"</strong> is not a keyword or an identifier; it is just some text to be printed.</p></div><p></p><p> </p><h5 id="keywords">Keywords</h5><p><video controls="" src="https://stepikvideo.blob.core.windows.net/video/265001/1080/2e79d94831cc6827b76dc28f2ca93db5.mp4"> Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos, but don't worry, you can <a href="https://stepikvideo.blob.core.windows.net/video/265001/1080/2e79d94831cc6827b76dc28f2ca93db5.mp4" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">download it</a> and watch it with your favorite video player! </video></p><p>As you can see, even a simple Java program consists of many elements, including <strong>keywords</strong> that are parts of the language.
